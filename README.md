# NaNoWriMo-Discord-Bot
**WARNING THIS BOT IS STILL IN EARLY ALPHA. THERE IS NO COMMENT IN THE CODE, AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME BUGS LEFT. THE CREATOR IS STILL ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT 2016/10/11**
This bot (Omlabot) is a small bot I've created. It uses the discord.js library, and is deployed through node.js.

It is currently only in French, but I plan to translate it to English soon.

It was built to support the Quebec city region NaNoWriMo group.

To make this bot work, you need to install discord.js (see their GitHub project).

You also need a auth.json file, and must start the project through node.js.

Better instructions will follow shortly.
