# NaNoWriMo-Discord-Bot
**WARNING THIS BOT IS STILL IN EARLY ALPHA. THERE IS NO COMMENT IN THE CODE, AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME BUGS LEFT. THE CREATOR IS STILL ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT 2016/10/11**

This bot (Omlabot) is a small bot I've created. It uses the discord.js library, and is deployed through node.js.

It is currently only in French, but I plan to translate it to English soon. It was built to support the Quebec city region NaNoWriMo group.

##I-Know-What-I'm-Doing Documentation

For this bot to work, you need to have node.js 6.0.0+ installed. This is to download [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/), which is required to run this bot.

Then, you need to open the auth.json file, and enter the e-mail and password of the account that will serve as your bot. You then simply need to run start.bat.
